            <h2>About edie</h2>
            <p>Welcome! I’m Kari. With edie, I share teaching tools and expert teacher tips to industry, non-profit, and business leaders in an effort to enhance facilitation and group leadership skills everywhere. In the business world, there’s a lot of buzz about learning, growth, collaboration, coaching, facilitation, and design, but these conversations rarely get linked explicitly to teaching. I’d like to spark a practical conversation about teaching and how great teaching tools can catalyze growth everywhere, not just in schools.</p>
            <p>I love teaching—so much so that I earned a PhD in the study of teaching. The name edie is a word-nerd riff on “education,” and a reference to my goddaughter, Edie Ambrose, whose clever, playful, risk-taking, and vibrant hold on life inspires the spirit of the brand.</p>
            <p>I’ve worked extensively with organizations as an Educational Designer, Consultant, and Teaching & Learning Strategist. With edie, I distill lessons learned over a 20-year career. I’m a Lecturer at UBC’s Sauder School of Business, teaching Creativity and Communication courses across Executive Education, undergraduate, and graduate-level programs.</p>
            <p>With edie, I’m excited to connect the great teachers with the great leaders in my network, a teaching/learning-themed inter-professional matchmaking service! I will draw on my network to make sure my clients work with consultants offering the skills they need.</p>
            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>“edie’s founder, Dr. Kari Marken, is a maverick of learning design, combining audacious curiosity with insightful strategy. Her approach is rare in this industry, and her work with our company significantly shaped the learning design and curriculum for a marginalized population.”</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>“I contacted Kari when I began building a professional certification program. During this preliminary phase, the program had yet to take shape and it was unclear on how to best assess our student's learning in the online space. Kari's unique qualifications allowed her to clearly identify potential obstacles, while offering strategies to productively address them.”</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>“Kari opened doors everyone else told me were closed. She masterfully captured the details I was lost in and synthesized them into a workable strategy. Usually when people try to simplify for me like this, essential nuance is lost. Not with Kari. She kept up with how fast I talked and thought, and left me knowing exactly what I needed to do next, what was possible and with how much work, and what was a dream and I should move on from. Her gentle, charming disposition belies her incisive, strategic vision. She will be an asset to your business.”</p>
